    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is one of the most flavorful and moist salmon recipes I have ever tasted.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lemons, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Put two large squares of aluminum foil onto a large,
            flat work surface.
        </li>
        <li>Make a bed of lemon slices in the center of each foil
            square; top with red onion. Lay a salmon fillet atop each
            pile of lemon slices and onion; season with basil, dill,
            and sea salt. Fold edges of the aluminum foil over the salmon
            and seal completely.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a
            fork, about 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove salmon from foil pouch, place on plate, and drizzle juices
            from foil pouch over the fish.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
