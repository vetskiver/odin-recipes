    <h1>Easy Air Fried Corn Rib</h1>
    <img src="/images/cornribs.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> These air fried corn ribs are reminiscent of Mexican street
        corn, but each ear is split into quarters and then air fried.
        I used frozen corn on the cob which I thawed.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ears ears corn on the cob</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons "Everything but
            the Elote seasoning" (Trader
            Joe's®), divided
        </li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used
            a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves
            flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total
            of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).</li>
        <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of
            seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.</li>
        <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and
            remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
