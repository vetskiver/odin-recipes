    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice
        </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup basil pesto</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently pound chicken breasts into even thickness using
            the smooth side of a meat mallet, about 1/2 inch thick.
            Place chicken into a resealable plastic bag.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic,
            Italian seasoning, and salt in a small bowl. Pour over
            chicken, coat evenly, and marinate for 4 to 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, salt, and
            pepper in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil
            the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and grill with the lid closed
            for 4 minutes. Flip chicken and grill an additional 3 to 4
            minutes. Top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese
            and 1 tablespoon of pesto, then top with cherry tomatoes.
            Close lid on grill and continue grilling until cheese is melted
            and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 3 more minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Using a spatula,
            carefully remove chicken to a serving platter.
        </li>
    </ol>
